# Pulse

A not so skeleton package for beginners to start PHP

### Why Pulse?
PHP is considered the most used language to serve web applications. 

It has faced lots of criticisms due to it's bad structure popularly based on allowing
vanilla or spaghetti coding where **HTML** is mixed with **PHP** and **JavaScript** all scattered in files.

Nowadays you will not see PHP in this mess because most frameworks have taken care of it.

And this leaves beginners to be doing the mess. 

**Pulse** comes in here to assist beginners to write code in a little cleaner manner.

It is currently used for building simple websites and as a learning environment for PHP beginners.

**Pulse** was created by **[Developer Kwame](https://developerkwame.com)**.
